# Basic Calculator

A calculator with the functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

## Motivation
This project was created to learn fundamentals of Javascript and improve problem solving skills.

## What I Learned
- Utilizing conditionals and functions in a problem solving scenario
- Connecting JS functions to buttons in HTML

## Future Features
Features to be implemented (possibly) if project were revisited
- [ ] Responsive
- [ ] Fix known bug - display not resetting after an operation when inputting new set of numbers

### Challenges
I really wanted to find the solution through fully functional programming by making the function loop into itself, but ended up having to manually call the functions in part 2, 8-10 times. I kept running into issues with infinite loops or getting errors due to variables not having the proper scope, it was a messy process of debugging repeatedly.

## Credits
Created following the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).
