# Single Operation Calculator

A calculator with the functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

## Motivation
This project was created to learn fundamentals of Javascript and improve problem solving skills.

## What I Learned
- Utilizing conditionals and functions in a problem solving scenario
- Connecting JS functions to buttons in HTML
- How to use debugger in dev tools to step through JS

## Things to Fix
Features to be implemented (possibly) if project were revisited
- [ ] Responsive
- [ ] Display not inputting new set of numbers after an operation
- [ ] PEDMAS not implemented
- [ ] Display font not importing properly with git submodule

### Challenges
The most difficult part of making this calculator was figuring out the logic of the equals button. I took each function step by step and did a lot of debugging using console.log to identify when I was storing the sum/operator variables. I couldn't figure out how to make PEDMAS operational, which will have to be something I revisit one day.
